# Gini Index Project

## Introduction
<!-- Write your introduction here -->
Gini index applied to analyze the Salary by Job Title and Country dataset.

The aim of this study is to determine if education and experience levels are related to salary inequality in the job market. The hypothesis for the results is a more equal distribution of salary among Bachelorâ€™s degrees, as most entry level positions offer a similar salary, and more unequal as the studies are continued, for the specializations offer more opportunities for salary differences. The same is expected for the period of experience.
